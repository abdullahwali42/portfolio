                <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
                
                <p>I try to understand the “why” behind every problem. Whether it’s improving something that already exists or creating a new experience from scratch, I rely on curiosity to help me get to the root instead of guessing.</p>
                
                <p>Before getting into UX, I studied Computer Science and spent time doing frontend development. That background still shows up in my design work today. It helps me think in systems and collaborate smoothly with developers without overcomplicating solutions.</p>
                
                <p>In my next role, I want to work closely with product, UX, research, and engineering teams to shape meaningful solutions and continue growing as a designer. I’m open to full-time roles across industries where thoughtful, research-driven product thinking can create clarity, trust, and better experiences for users.</p>
